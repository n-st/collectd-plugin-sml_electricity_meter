collectd-sml: collectd plugin to receive data from SML-capable energy meters
============================================================================

jSML is a Java library implementing the Smart Message Language (SML).

`collectd-sml` receives SML data files from an electronic energy meter and
makes it available to collectd via the collectd Java plugin interface.

The fields in collectdâ€™s data packets are set as follows:

* hostname = [set at compile-time]
* plugin = `smlreceiver`
* plugin_instance = [SML server ID]
* type = `watts` or `watt_hours`
* type_instance = [OBIS code]

Context
-------

This software has been developed in the context of the bachelor's thesis
["Measuring, Visualizing, and Optimizing the Energy Consumption of Computer
Clusters"](https://www.sosy-lab.org/research/bsc/steinger/).
The thesis provides more information about the hardware and software
environment that this plugin was designed to be used in.

Setup
-----

All new data types must be manually added to Collectd's type list (the path to
which is specified in collectd.conf).
For most values from the SML energy meter, a simple positive-only gauge should
suffice, e.g.
```
watts       value:GAUGE:0:U
watt_hours  value:GAUGE:0:U
```

To load this plugin into a collectd instance, a configuration stanza similar to
the following has to be added to `collectd.conf`:
```
<Plugin "java">
  JVMArg "-Djava.class.path=/opt/collectd/lib/collectd/bindings/java"
  LoadPlugin "de.voidptr.collectd_plugins.SMLReceiver"
  <Plugin "de.voidptr.collectd_plugins.SMLReceiver">
    SerialPort = "/dev/ttyAMA0"
  </Plugin>
</Plugin>
```
